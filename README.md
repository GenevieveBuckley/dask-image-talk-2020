This talk introduces dask-image, a python library for distributed image processing. Targeted towards applications involving large array data too big to fit in memory, dask-image is built on top of numpy, scipy, and dask allowing easy scalability and portability from your laptop to the supercomputing cluster. It is of broad interest for a diverse range of data analysis applications such as video/streaming data, computer vision, and scientific fields including astronomy, microscopy and geosciences. We will provide a general overview of the dask-image library, then discuss mixing and matching with your own custom functions, and present a practical case study of a python image processing pipeline.
